# 🎸 Guitar Website

This is a fully responsive three-page website about **guitars**, built using **HTML** and **CSS**. The project is based on a custom design that I personally created and illustrated using **Figma**.

## 🚀 Features

* **Responsive Design** – Fully adaptable across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
* **Custom Figma Design** – All UI elements and layout were designed by me from scratch in Figma.
* **Burger Menu** – A mobile-friendly burger menu implemented with **JavaScript** for toggling navigation.
* **Component-Based Structure** – The `header` and `footer` are separated into reusable components and added to all three pages dynamically using the **Fetch API**.
* **Clean & Semantic HTML** – Proper use of semantic elements for better structure and accessibility.

## 📁 Pages

* **Home** (`index.html`)
* **About** (`about.html`)
* **Contact** (`contact.html`)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries)
* JavaScript (for burger menu and dynamic content loading)
* Figma (UI/UX Design)

## 🎨 Figma Design

The original design for the website was created in **Figma** by me.
